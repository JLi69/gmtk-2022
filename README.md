# My GMTK Game Jam Submission 2022
This is a quick game that I made using C++ for the GMTK game jam.

I didn't realize that the jam started until about a day after so unfortunately I wasn't able to do as much work on this game.

However, I still hope that this game is still mildly fun and interesting.
